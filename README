SYNOPSIS
        use Markup::TreeNode;
        my $new_node = Markup::TreeNode->new(tagname => 'p');

DESCRIPTION
    This module exists pretty much soley for Markup::Tree. I'm sure you can
    find plenty of other uses for it, but that's probably the best. Please
    let me know if and how you use this outside of it's purpose, I'm very
    intrested :).

PROPERTIES
    At object instantiation (initilization) the following properties can be
    set. Addtionally, they can be read/written in a standard hash way: print
    $node->{'text'}.

    element_type
        The type of element in question. Valid values follow:

        tag This is the default value and it represents a standard document
            element.

        -->text
            TreeNodes of this element type represent textual objects.

        -->declaration
            In the real-world you'll probably have one or none of these. It
            is the declaration that the XML or HTML tree has provided. Look
            at the "text" property to see what the declaration was (intact
            minus the <! >.

        -->comment
            This is a representation of comments in markup.

        -->ignore
            "element_types" marked with -->ignore will be overlooked (but
            not children of -->ignore (unless they also are -->ignore)) by
            Markup::Tree's "foreach_node" and "save_as" methods.

        -->pi
            Processing Instruction. The "tagname" will be either "asp-style"
            or "php-style" depending on wheter the tag was started and ended
            with % or ?.

    tagname
        For tag "element_type"s this is the name of the element.

        For -->pi "element_type"s this is either "asp-style" or "php-style"
        depending on wheter the tag was started and ended with % or ?.

        For all other elements it is usually the same as "element_type".

    attr
        A reference to an anonymous hash. This represents the elements
        attributes in name => value pairs (a hash).

    level
        Internally this setting is never used. Markup::Tree uses it to
        represent the depth or indentation level. You may find other uses
        for it. Default value is 0.

    parent
        When present, this is the reference to the parent
        "Markup::TreeNode". If empty the value of this property is
        '(empty)'.

    child_num
        Internally this is used to represent which child number of our
        parent we are. Again, you may find another use for it.

    children
        A reference to an anonymous array of "Markup::TreeNodes"s.

    text
        The text of the object. Likely -->text or -->declaration will have
        this set.

METHODS
    attach_parent ("Markup::TreeNode")
        The safe way of assigning a parent. Adds the current node to the
        last of the new parent's children list.

    attach_child ("Markup::TreeNode")
        The safe way of assigning a child. Adds proper parent links and
        "child_num"s.

    attach_child_before ("Markup::TreeNode")
        The safe way of assigning a child. Adds proper parent links and
        "child_num"s.

        The difference between this method and the "attach_child" method is
        that this method will add the specified child as the first child of
        it's children, rather than the last.

    attach_children (ARRAYREF)
        The safe way of assigning a children to a parent. Adds proper parent
        links and "child_num"s.

    get_text ( )
        If the current object is a -->text object it simply returns its
        text; Otherwise if the "next_node" is a text, returns its text. If
        all fails, undef is returned.

    next_node ( )
        Returns the next "Markup::TreeNode" in the tree or undef if at the
        bottom (or if the algo screwed up).

    previous_node ( )
        Returns the previous "Markup::TreeNode" in the tree or undef if at
        the top (or if the algo screwed up).

    drop ( )
        Drops (deletes) the current node and all of its children. Returns
        the dropped node.

    replace ("Markup::TreeNode")
        Replaces the current node with the specified one. Returns the
        replaced node.

    insert ("Markup::TreeNode", position)
        Arguments:

        "Markup::TreeNode"
            The node you want to insert

        position
            May be one of 'before' or 'after'. The default is 'after'.

        This method will insert the specified node either before or after
        itself, depending on the "position".
